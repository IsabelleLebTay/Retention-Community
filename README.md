# Small-scale residual retention: who uses it anyway?

Residual retention is when mature trees are left behind in harvested cutblocks. In Alberta, the legislation guiding the practise stipulates that there must be an avergae 5% of tree unlogged in harvest areas. Harvest areas are made of several cutblocks, so some get more retention than others, and some might not get any. <br>
Residual retention is generally left as patches of trees, which range from 1 tree to 2 ha in size. The trees must be of "commercial" quality, which happens to be old, useful and productive trees to songbirds.<br>

From the literature, the adage "any retention is useful" is applied here, since these patches can be as small as a two or three trees. However, most of the experiments on the value of live tree retention is on much larger scale retention, where amounts are at a minimum 10% harvest cover.<br>

We are testing whether smaller-scale retention, form 0.1 - 1.2 ha, provides any value to forest songbirds. We visited over 400 sites where harvests were within the first 22 years of regeneration, from all the forests in Alberta. <br>

From an abundance analysis of 6 species, we found retention is impportant and indeed used, and that the number of individuals is not proportional to the path area (Lebeuf-Taylor et al., 2024). Rather, the amount of patch edge plays a more ecological imortant role for most songbirds. All of the value that retention patches did confer started after around 10 years of regeneration.<br>

Central to this finding was the development and application of a perceptibility truncation method, which ensures our acoustic sampling radius is equal acorss sites and specific in its size. The method, however, requires identificaiton of non-masked individual songs, which is a labour-intensive method. <br>

We originally hypothesized that at the community level, such sampling refining was not necessary. However, the bird community was analysed for its potential response to retention  using conventional unlimited perceptability surveys, and the results did not align with the findings in our paper on select species.<br>

To fix this, we have to apply the perceibility truncation method. We are testing a way where only a single indiviual of each detected species is tagged, and each speices per visit has a tag for its least masked song. We can then apply the perceptibility truncation method on detection/non-detection data, based on the assumption that if the loudest individual is truncated out due to song faintness, no other individuals were within our specified sampling radius. <br>

From this, we are applying a single multi-species occupancy model, which includes a species & site-specific detection submodel.
