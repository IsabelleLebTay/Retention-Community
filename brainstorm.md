# Community analysis

What are the elogical questions?

Environmental gradients: retnetion patch size, age of harvest, surrounding forest type.

Observed responses: 
1. number of species per location
2. number of individuals of each species per location
3. detection/non-detection of each species per location
4. diversity index

Common approaches:
- logistic regression for each species. 1 model?
- PCA, or clustering
- Functional group response? Probably the "open" species will dislike the retention patches.
- Threshold where some species will really show up? for the richness
- By species, abundance GLM, as Poisson
- By species, piecewise regression, Lionel's paper
- Species richness as response, GLM with the same covariates as my other paper
